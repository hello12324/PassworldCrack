# My project
  ## ANN(Artificial Neural Network) ----status (not executable, in progress)
  	Here is my simple artificial neural network, which is just a prototype and cannot be implemented
  
  ## leibniz_transformation ---- status (executable, to be optimized)
  	Leibniz transformation is a mathematical method for converting a time function into its complex plane function representation. Leibniz transformation is most commonly used to solve ordinary differential equations (differential equations), and is also commonly used to analyze electrical and electronic Signals in systems and system dynamic behavior.
	Specifically, the Leibniz transform can convert the differential and integral terms in the time function into the product and sum of persimmons (complex functions), so that the linear algebra method can be used to solve the problem. Leibniz transform It can also be used to analyze the steady-state behavior of the system (steady-state behavior), because in the steady state, the state of the system does not change anymore, and the complex spectrum analysis can be used to study the nature of the system. Not necessarily Correct, but that's about it.
  
  ## PassworldCrack ---- status (runnable, to be optimized)
  	This is a project that does not require a dictionary to generate passwords in real time. It only needs a "DefaultPassworld.txt" file (the file needs to be in the same directory as the program or in the path of the terminal, but the path can be customized at runtime), and there are 94 inside the file Characters (commonly used characters can also be customized) to generate a password, using the basic application of discrete mathematics, combinatorics (Combinatorics), as shown below

	## If there are 3 characters in total, to crack a 2-digit password, the arrangement and combination are as follows
		1. aa --
		2. ab   |
		3. ac   |
		4. b    |
		5. bb   | =>[there are 3 to the power of 2 in total]
		6. bc   |
		7. ca   |
		8. cb   |
		9. cc __|
	The use of linear arrangement is to consider the order, so there is still a problem with efficiency.
  
  ## PassworldProgram ----status (can run, to be optimized)
  	This is a program with a password, just simply write tests, such as time attack tests and so on.
  
  ## other Project ---- Status (Unknown!)
  	NONE.
